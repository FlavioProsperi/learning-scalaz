### About those Monoids

LYAHFGG:

> It seems that both `*` together with `1` and `++` along with `[]` share some common properties:
> - The function takes two parameters.
> - The parameters and the returned value have the same type.
> - There exists such a value that doesn't change other values when used with the binary function.

Let's check it out in Scala:

```scala
scala> 4 * 1
res16: Int = 4

scala> 1 * 9
res17: Int = 9

scala> List(1, 2, 3) ++ Nil
res18: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)

scala> Nil ++ List(0.5, 2.5)
res19: List[Double] = List(0.5, 2.5)
```

Looks right.

LYAHFGG:

> It doesn't matter if we do `(3 * 4) * 5` or `3 * (4 * 5)`. Either way, the result is `60`. The same goes for `++`.
> ...
> We call this property *associativity*. `*` is associative, and so is `++`, but `-`, for example, is not.

Let's check this too:

```scala
scala> (3 * 2) * (8 * 5) assert_=== 3 * (2 * (8 * 5))

scala> List("la") ++ (List("di") ++ List("da")) assert_=== (List("la") ++ List("di")) ++ List("da")
```

No error means, they are equal. Apparently this is what monoid is.

### Monoid

LYAHFGG:

> A *monoid* is when you have an associative binary function and a value which acts as an identity with respect to that function. 

Let's see [the typeclass contract for `Monoid` in Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/scalaz-seven/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Monoid.scala):

```scala
trait Monoid[A] extends Semigroup[A] { self =>
  ////
  /** The identity element for `append`. */
  def zero: A
  
  ...
}
```

### Semigroup

Looks like `Monoid` extends `Semigroup` so let's [look at its typeclass](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/scalaz-seven/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Semigroup.scala).

```scala
trait Semigroup[A]  { self =>
  def append(a1: A, a2: => A): A
  ...
}
```

Here are [the operators](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/scalaz-seven/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/syntax/SemigroupSyntax.scala):

```scala
trait SemigroupOps[A] extends Ops[A] {
  final def |+|(other: => A): A = A.append(self, other)
  final def mappend(other: => A): A = A.append(self, other)
  final def ⊹(other: => A): A = A.append(self, other)
}
```

It introduces `mappend` operator with symbolic alias `|+|` and `⊹`.

LYAHFGG:

> We have `mappend`, which, as you've probably guessed, is the binary function. It takes two values of the same type and returns a value of that type as well.

LYAHFGG also warns that just because it's named `mappend` it does not mean it's appending something, like in the case of `*`. Let's try using this.

```scala
scala> List(1, 2, 3) mappend List(4, 5, 6)
res23: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

scala> "one" mappend "two"
res25: String = onetwo
```

I think the idiomatic Scalaz way is to use `|+|`:

```scala
scala> List(1, 2, 3) |+| List(4, 5, 6)
res26: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

scala> "one" |+| "two"
res27: String = onetwo
```

This looks more concise.

### Back to Monoid

```scala
trait Monoid[A] extends Semigroup[A] { self =>
  ////
  /** The identity element for `append`. */
  def zero: A
  
  ...
}
```

LYAHFGG:

> `mempty` represents the identity value for a particular monoid.

Scalaz calls this `zero` instead.

```scala
scala> Monoid[List[Int]].zero
res15: List[Int] = List()

scala> Monoid[String].zero
res16: String = ""
```

### Tags.Multiplication

LYAHFGG:

> So now that there are two equally valid ways for numbers (addition and multiplication) to be monoids, which way do choose? Well, we don't have to.

This is where Scalaz 7 uses tagged type. The built-in tags are [Tags][tags]. There are 8 tags for Monoids and 1 named `Zip` for `Applicative`. (Is this the Zip List I couldn't find yesterday?)

```scala
scala> Tags.Multiplication(10) |+| Monoid[Int @@ Tags.Multiplication].zero
res21: scalaz.@@[Int,scalaz.Tags.Multiplication] = 10
```

Nice! So we can multiply numbers using `|+|`. For addition, we use plain `Int`.

```scala
scala> 10 |+| Monoid[Int].zero
res22: Int = 10
```

### Tags.Disjunction and Tags.Conjunction

LYAHFGG:

> Another type which can act like a monoid in two distinct but equally valid ways is `Bool`. The first way is to have the or function `||` act as the binary function along with `False` as the identity value. 
> ...
> The other way for `Bool` to be an instance of `Monoid` is to kind of do the opposite: have `&&` be the binary function and then make `True` the identity value. 

In Scalaz 7 these are called `Boolean @@ Tags.Disjunction` and `Boolean @@ Tags.Conjunction` respectively.

```scala
scala> Tags.Disjunction(true) |+| Tags.Disjunction(false)
res28: scalaz.@@[Boolean,scalaz.Tags.Disjunction] = true

scala> Monoid[Boolean @@ Tags.Disjunction].zero |+| Tags.Disjunction(true)
res29: scalaz.@@[Boolean,scalaz.Tags.Disjunction] = true

scala> Monoid[Boolean @@ Tags.Disjunction].zero |+| Monoid[Boolean @@ Tags.Disjunction].zero
res30: scalaz.@@[Boolean,scalaz.Tags.Disjunction] = false

scala> Monoid[Boolean @@ Tags.Conjunction].zero |+| Tags.Conjunction(true)
res31: scalaz.@@[Boolean,scalaz.Tags.Conjunction] = true

scala> Monoid[Boolean @@ Tags.Conjunction].zero |+| Tags.Conjunction(false)
res32: scalaz.@@[Boolean,scalaz.Tags.Conjunction] = false
```

### Ordering as Monoid

LYAHFGG:

> With `Ordering`, we have to look a bit harder to recognize a monoid, but it turns out that its `Monoid` instance is just as intuitive as the ones we've met so far and also quite useful.

Sounds odd, but let's check it out.

```scala
scala> Ordering.LT |+| Ordering.GT
<console>:14: error: value |+| is not a member of object scalaz.Ordering.LT
              Ordering.LT |+| Ordering.GT
                          ^

scala> (Ordering.LT: Ordering) |+| (Ordering.GT: Ordering)
res42: scalaz.Ordering = LT

scala> (Ordering.GT: Ordering) |+| (Ordering.LT: Ordering)
res43: scalaz.Ordering = GT

scala> Monoid[Ordering].zero |+| (Ordering.LT: Ordering)
res44: scalaz.Ordering = LT

scala> Monoid[Ordering].zero |+| (Ordering.GT: Ordering)
res45: scalaz.Ordering = GT
```

LYAHFGG:

> OK, so how is this monoid useful? Let's say you were writing a function that takes two strings, compares their lengths, and returns an `Ordering`. But if the strings are of the same length, then instead of returning `EQ` right away, we want to compare them alphabetically. 

Because the left comparison is kept unless it's `Ordering.EQ` we can use this to compose two levels of comparisons. Let's try implementing `lengthCompare` using Scalaz:

```scala
scala> def lengthCompare(lhs: String, rhs: String): Ordering =
         (lhs.length ?|? rhs.length) |+| (lhs ?|? rhs)
lengthCompare: (lhs: String, rhs: String)scalaz.Ordering

scala> lengthCompare("zen", "ants")
res46: scalaz.Ordering = LT

scala> lengthCompare("zen", "ant")
res47: scalaz.Ordering = GT
```

It works. "zen" is `LT` compared to "ants" because it's shorter.

We still have more Monoids, but let's call it a day. We'll pick it up from here later.
