### Kinds and some type-foo

One section I should've covered yesterday from [Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses][moott] but didn't is about kinds and types. I thought it wouldn't matter much to understand Scalaz, but it does, so we need to have the talk.

[Learn You a Haskell For Great Good][moott] says:

> Types are little labels that values carry so that we can reason about the values. But types have their own little labels, called kinds. A kind is more or less the type of a type. 
> ...
> What are kinds and what are they good for? Well, let's examine the kind of a type by using the :k command in GHCI.

I did not find `:k` command for Scala REPL in Scala 2.10, so I wrote one: [kind.scala](https://gist.github.com/eed3si9n/3610635). With George Leontiev ([@folone](https://twitter.com/folone)), who sent in [scala/scala#2340](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2340), and others' help `:kind` command is now part of Scala 2.11. Let's try using it:

```
scala> :k Int
scala.Int's kind is A

scala> :k -v Int
scala.Int's kind is A
*
This is a proper type.

scala> :k -v Option
scala.Option's kind is F[+A]
* -(+)-> *
This is a type constructor: a 1st-order-kinded type.

scala> :k -v Either
scala.util.Either's kind is F[+A1,+A2]
* -(+)-> * -(+)-> *
This is a type constructor: a 1st-order-kinded type.

scala> :k -v Equal
scalaz.Equal's kind is F[A]
* -> *
This is a type constructor: a 1st-order-kinded type.

scala> :k -v Functor
scalaz.Functor's kind is X[F[A]]
(* -> *) -> *
This is a type constructor that takes type constructor(s): a higher-kinded type.
```

From the top. `Int` and every other types that you can make a value out of is called a proper type and denoted with a symbol `*` (read "type"). This is analogous to value `1` at value-level. Using Scala's type variable notation this could be written as `A`.

A first-order value, or a value constructor like `(_: Int) + 3`, is normally called a function. Similarly, a first-order-kinded type is a type that accepts other types to create a proper type. This is normally called a type constructor. `Option`, `Either`, and `Equal` are all first-order-kinded. To denote that these accept other types, we use curried notation like `* -> *` and `* -> * -> *`. Note, `Option[Int]` is `*`; `Option` is `* -> *`. Using Scala's type variable notation they could be written as `F[+A]` and `F[+A1,+A2]`.

A higher-order value like `(f: Int => Int, list: List[Int]) => list map {f}`, a function that accepts other functions is normally called higher-order function. Similarly, a higher-kinded type is a type constructor that accepts other type constructors. It probably should be called a higher-kinded type constructor but the name is not used. These are denoted as `(* -> *) -> *`. Using Scala's type variable notation this could be written as `X[F[A]]`.

In case of Scalaz 7.1, `Equal` and others have the kind `F[A]` while `Functor` and all its derivatives have the kind `X[F[A]]`.
Scala encodes (or complects) the notion of type class using type constructor, and the terminology tend get jumbled up. For example, the data structure `List` forms a functor, in the sense that an instance `Functor[List]` can be derived for `List`. Since there should be only one instance for `List`, we can say that `List` is a functor. See the following discussion for more on "is-a":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>In FP, &quot;is-a&quot; means &quot;an instance can be derived from.&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/jimduey">@jimduey</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPL14?src=hash">#CPL14</a> It&#39;s a provable relationship, not reliant on LSP.</p>&mdash; Jessica Kerr (@jessitron) <a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/438432946383360000">February 25, 2014</a></blockquote>

Since `List` is `F[+A]`, it's easy to remember that `F` relates to a functor. Except, the typeclass definition `Functor` needs to wrap `F[A]` around, so its kind is `X[F[A]]`. To add to the confusion, the fact that Scala can treat type constructor as a first class variable was novel enough, that the compiler calls first-order kinded type as "higher-kinded type":

```scala
scala> trait Test {
         type F[_]
       }
<console>:14: warning: higher-kinded type should be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.higherKinds visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import scala.language.higherKinds'
or by setting the compiler option -language:higherKinds.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.higherKinds for a discussion
why the feature should be explicitly enabled.
         type F[_]
              ^
```

You normally don't have to worry about this if you are using injected operators like:

```scala
scala> List(1, 2, 3).shows
res11: String = [1,2,3]
```

But if you want to use `Show[A].shows`, you have to know it's `Show[List[Int]]`, not `Show[List]`. Similarly, if you want to lift a function, you need to know that it's `Functor[F]` (`F` is for `Functor`):

```scala
scala> Functor[List[Int]].lift((_: Int) + 2)
<console>:14: error: List[Int] takes no type parameters, expected: one
              Functor[List[Int]].lift((_: Int) + 2)
                      ^

scala> Functor[List].lift((_: Int) + 2)
res13: List[Int] => List[Int] = <function1>
```

In [the cheat sheet][cheatsheet] I started I originally had type parameters for `Equal` written as `Equal[F]`, which is the same as Scalaz 7's source code. Adam Rosien pointed out to me that it should be `Equal[A]`. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/eed3si9n">eed3si9n</a> love the scalaz cheat sheet start, but using the type param F usually means Functor, what about A instead?</p>&mdash; Adam Rosien (@arosien) <a href="https://twitter.com/arosien/status/241990437269815296">September 1, 2012</a></blockquote>

Now it makes sense why!
