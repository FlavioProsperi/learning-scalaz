Lawless typeclasses
-------------------

Scalaz 7.0 contains several typeclasses that are now deemed lawless by Scalaz project: `Length`, `Index`, and `Each`. Some discussions can be found in [#278 What to do about lawless classes?](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/issues/278) and [(presumably) Bug in IndexedSeq Index typeclass](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scalaz/aJx69eWMK6M/gAtne2v6RJYJ). The three will be deprecated in 7.1, and removed in 7.2.

### Length

There's a typeclass that expresses length. Here's [the typeclass contract of `Length`](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/scalaz-seven/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Length.scala):

```scala
trait Length[F[_]]  { self =>
  def length[A](fa: F[A]): Int
}
```

This introduces `length` method. In Scala standard library it's introduced by `SeqLike`, so it could become useful if there were data structure that does not extend `SeqLike` that has length.

### Index

For random access into a container, there's [`Index`](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/scalaz-seven/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Index.scala):

```scala
trait Index[F[_]]  { self =>
  def index[A](fa: F[A], i: Int): Option[A]
}
```

This introduces `index` and `indexOr` methods:

```scala
trait IndexOps[F[_],A] extends Ops[F[A]] {
  final def index(n: Int): Option[A] = F.index(self, n)
  final def indexOr(default: => A, n: Int): A = F.indexOr(self, default, n)
}
```

This is similar to `List(n)` except it returns `None` for an out-of-range index:

```scala
scala> List(1, 2, 3)(3)
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: 3
        ...

scala> List(1, 2, 3) index 3
res62: Option[Int] = None
```

### Each

For running side effects along a data structure, there's [`Each`](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/scalaz-seven/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Each.scala):

```scala
trait Each[F[_]]  { self =>
  def each[A](fa: F[A])(f: A => Unit)
}
```

This introduces `foreach` method:

```scala
sealed abstract class EachOps[F[_],A] extends Ops[F[A]] {
  final def foreach(f: A => Unit): Unit = F.each(self)(f)
}
```

### Foldable or rolling your own?

Some of the functionality above can be emulated using `Foldable`, but as [@nuttycom](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/issues/278#issuecomment-16748242) suggested, that would force *O(n)* time even when the underlying data structure implements contact time for `length` and `index`. At that point, we'd be better off rolling our own `Length` if it's actually useful to abstract over `length`.

If inconsistent implementations of these typeclasses were somehow compromising the typesafety I'd understand removing them from the library, but `Length` and `Index` sound like a legitimate abstraction of randomly accessible containers like `Vector`.

### Pointed and Copointed

Another set of typeclasses that was axed earlier was `Pointed` and `Copointed`. There were more interesting arguments on them that can be found in [Pointed/Copointed][pc] and [Why not Pointed?][why]:

> `Pointed` has no useful laws and almost all applications people point to for it are actually abuses of ad hoc relationships it happens to have for the instances it does offer.

This actually is an interesting line of argument that I can understand. In other words, if any container can qualify as `Pointed`, the code using it either is not very useful or it's likely making specific assumption about the instance.

We'll pick it up from here later.
