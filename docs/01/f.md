### Enum

LYAHFGG:

> `Enum` members are sequentially ordered types â€” they can be enumerated. The main advantage of the `Enum` typeclass is that we can use its types in list ranges. They also have defined successors and predecesors, which you can get with the `succ` and `pred` functions.

Scalaz equivalent for the `Enum` typeclass is `Enum`:

```scala
scala> 'a' to 'e'
res30: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange.Inclusive[Char] = NumericRange(a, b, c, d, e)

scala> 'a' |-> 'e'
res31: List[Char] = List(a, b, c, d, e)

scala> 3 |=> 5
res32: scalaz.EphemeralStream[Int] = scalaz.EphemeralStreamFunctions\$\$anon\$4@6a61c7b6

scala> 'B'.succ
res33: Char = C
```

Instead of the standard `to`, `Enum` enables `|->` that returns a `List` by declaring `pred` and `succ` method on top of `Order` typeclass. There are a bunch of other operations it enables like `-+-`, `---`, `from`, `fromStep`, `pred`, `predx`, `succ`, `succx`, `|-->`, `|->`, `|==>`, and `|=>`. It seems like these are all about stepping forward or backward, and returning ranges.
