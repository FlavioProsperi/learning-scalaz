### Thanks for reading

This page a placeholder for the end, but I'll be updating this series every now and then. Thanks for the comments and retweets!

Kudos to Miran Lipovača for writing [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). It really helped to have the book as a guide with many examples. 

And of course, [the authors and contributors][1] of Scalaz deserve some shoutout! Here are the top 10 from the list:

- [@xuwei-k][xuwei-k] Kenji Yoshida
- [@tonymorris][tonymorris] Tony Morris
- [@larsrh][larsrh] Lars Hupel

It was fun learning functional programming through Scalaz, and I hope the learning continues. Oh yea, don't forget the [Scalaz cheat sheet](http://eed3si9n.com/scalaz-cheat-sheet) too.
